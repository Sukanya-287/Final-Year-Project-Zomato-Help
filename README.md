# Final-Year-Project-Zomato-Help
This is my Engineering Final sem project which is done on the analysis of Zomato database

Website name : Zomato help

Our project, based on a Zomato dataset of restaurants, delves into the local food delivery market to gain
valuable insights. It begins with data collection and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure data quality,
followed by subsequent analysis to optimize business operations. By providing actionable data-driven
insights, our project aims to enhance the local food delivery market's competitiveness and customer
satisfaction. For new restaurant owners, we address the lack of comprehensive market analysis tools by
offering detailed visualizations. These include the number of restaurants in various locations, types of
orders (dine-in, takeout, delivery), online versus offline presence, and ratings across different attributes
such as food quality, service, and ambiance. This helps owners identify underserved areas with high
demand, understand customer preferences, and make informed decisions about where to establish their
business. For customers, our website categorizes reviews into food, restaurant, and service, with sentiment
analysis dividing them into positive, neutral, and negative, helping users make better dining choices.
Additionally, we have used data from Zomato and can incorporate live data if available, allowing the
project to update details in real-time. The platform is built using Python for EDA and the MERN stack
(MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the frontend and backend, ensuring robustness and
scalability. By leveraging these technologies, we provide a comprehensive tool for both restaurant owners
and customers to navigate the local food delivery market effectively.

Upon this all I have also published my first ever a conference paper in IEEE
